A Greasemonkey User Script
==========================
v 2.1

Summary
-------
This script adds (currently) one tab to the Netflix navigation menu. It sends you to Your Ratings, and lists the number of titles you've rated. In version 2.0, it has been updated to support Netflix's new user interface, which I have creatively titled "Netflix November 2010".

How to Use
----------
Install it. Ba-ba-ba-boom.
